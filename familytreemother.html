<b>Where were you born?</b><br>I was born in Howick, Auckland, NZ. <br>
<br>
<b>How did your ancestors come to NZ?</b><br>My dad came to NZ because of work. <br>
<br>
<b>What was your house like as a child?</b><br> My lifestyle as a child was very nomadic. While I never really had a constant place to call home, I was still happy being raised as the eldest child of 4 children. At times I wanted to make it three two or one but it was good overall. Sharing a bed with my sister made me question the necessity of siblings but as far as I’m aware there are still 4 of us. <br>
<br>
<b>Do you practice a religion?</b><br> No, I am agnostic. <br>
<br>
<b>What impact has religion had on your life?</b><br> My parents were somewhat extreme in their beliefs which were alternative with judeo christian origins. While I respect and embrace many of the core principles of Christianity, I feel that the more I learn or observe of religion, the less religious I become. Incidentally, the principles of Christianity that I value are shared with many other mainstream religions (it’s not that original to believe in being a decent human being). <br>
<br>
<b>What were your hobbies?</b><br>Playing on the railroad tracks, spotting the shedded snakeskin, catching fireflies and releasing them in the dark house and unsuccessfully plotting the capture of bird life. <br>

<br>
<b>How did you hear about world news?</b><br>My dad religiously watched the 6 o’clock news and I would often sit in, other times my parents who had socialist, anarchist tendencies would disseminate their version of world events to me combined with their religious spin on said events. Occasionally this would backfire, like the time my American grandfather visited us in Central India when I was 6 and I told him that Ronald Reagan was a very bad man and was going to hell. That was my first time meeting him (howdy grandad). <br>
<br>
<b>What could you tell me that I would be surprised to learn about you?</b><br>I am a master at hiding. No questions. <br>
<br>
<b>What is the earliest memory that you have?</b><br>My earliest memory is when I remember a sunny backyard somewhere in NZ and I remember looking at a small set of steps. My mom was there with a couple of my friends. <br>
<br>
<b>What do you remember about your parents or grandparents?</b><br>Growing up, I remember my mom as being very affectionate, enjoying doing arts and crafts with us, not a very harsh disciplinarian. Dad was a lot of fun. He would read us stories, affect crazy accents (sometimes he’d forget that people from foreign countries don’t understand him better if he speaks broken english like them). He means well. We often played hide and seek and other games. Our dad was the fun dad except with board games which I came to hate in my teens. He unsuccessfully tried to guilt us into playing. Now I avoid board games at all cost which is unfortunate for Bianca who shares this one similarity with her grandfather. I never met my american grandmother. I met my american grandfather once while living in India and he stayed with us for a week. He was bald, he gave us candy and he liked me even though I parroted my parents political views which he didn’t share. He’s my earliest memory of a grandparent. My american grandfather was a school principal and my american grandmother was a headmistress. My kiwi grandparents: My grandad had a stroke quite young which left him in a wheelchair and unable to communicate effectively. I remember my grandad was very happy to see us except when we would climb the wrong tree (all the trees) and then he would mutter something incoherent, shake his fist and go red. In hindsight, he was probably just worried we would get hurt. My nana was lovely. She was a hard worker, always looking after my grandad and making sure we were full of cookies and cordial ice blocks and had lots of fruit to take home from the garden. I didn’t get to know her until she was quite elderly and her sight and hearing were failing. But she was lovely and I miss her.<br>
<br>
<b>My Thoughts:</b><br> The way my mom described her lifestyle was quite amusing and I found her religious views to be interesting. I agree with her that the core principles of Christianity are good but like her, the more I learn of religion, the less religious I become. Her upbringing sounds very... eventful and after this interview, I believe I should talk with her more about what she did when she was younger and what life was like for her when she was constantly moving around.<br>
