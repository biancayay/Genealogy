<b>Where were you born?</b><br>I was born in Helensville, Auckland, NZ. <br>
<br>
<b>How did your ancestors come to NZ?</b><br> My grandparents on my dads side moved here when I was 4 years old for free healthcare even though they had money. They came here on 7th September 2003 when they heard of the prophecy of Bianca, the better grandchild (may or may not be true). <br>
<br>
<b>What was your house like as a child?</b><br> I like to separate my childhood into two stages: pre-divorce and post-divorce. Pre-divorce, my family was happy. A bit unruly but moving up. Post-divorce, I found I had a lot more responsibilities as the eldest daughter and my parents depended on me a lot since they were single parents. I found that I became like the third parent to my siblings.<br>
<br>
<img class="TextWrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/GAmnGHY.jpg">
<b>Do you practice a religion?</b><br>I used to be catholic because being catholic is an inherent part of filipino culture, however, as I grew older and I tried harder and harder to hold onto my faith, it became obvious that I didn’t believe so much because I believed there to be a God but because I believed to be a good filipino daughter I was meant to believe in God. I thought that I must have had some sort of deficit but as I got older, I realised that I couldn’t believe in a church that acted so poorly on the principles it was built on. Now, I identify as agnostic.<br>
<br>
<b>What impact has religion had on your life?</b><br>Religion has been a constant in my upbringing. From when I was a young child being sent to the naughty corner and being told that I couldn’t leave until I said sorry to Jesus to graduating from an all girls catholic school, religion has always been at the very least a background noise and at the most a force to be reckoned with. While I don’t believe in any particular religious doctrine anymore, I do carry many values from catholicism with me and I do think that it adds to what it means to be a moral person. I appreciate this.<br>
<br>
<b>What were your hobbies?</b><br>Growing up, I was an avid tryer of all things. From gymnastics, to cheerleading, basketball, cross country, debating and korean fan dance. However, my biggest hobby which has remained a constant throughout my whole childhood was reading which I did deeply and widely. <br>
<br>
<b>How did you hear about world news?</b><br>World news was always a topic of keen discussion growing up. I was never sheltered from the events by my parents and so I developed skills for critical thinking early on.<br>
<br>
<b>What could you tell me that I would be surprised to learn about you?</b><br>While I have some very liberal views in terms of how society should be structured, I still struggle to come to an agreement whether euthanasia should be legal. A big part of asian culture is philipiaty and respect for the elderly and having been raised as both asian and european, I suppose my inner turmoil surrounding this issue is reflective of my two starkly different heritages interacting.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the earliest memory that you have?</b><br>I think it was the first time I was consciously aware of myself. I was two years old and I was living in a house before Bianca was born. I woke up in the sun room, my head had been on the window sill and I went off to play.<br>
<br>
<b>What do you remember about your parents or grandparents?</b><br>My mother and father came from very different world and very different interests. In hindsight as an adult, I find it surprising that they were once married. My mother has transformed from a newly divorced woman, lacking confidence, to a fiercely independent successful businesswoman who has just as many career achievements as she does personal. I have a lot of respect for her, both as a daughter and as a feminist. My father has always been a talented musician and a great family man. He has always put his family's needs above his own and I have a lot that I owe to him as a daughter. I think he is one of the most resilient people I will ever meet. My maternal grandparents are self professed christian hippies and it shows in the way that they garden and decorate their house with african ornaments, pictures of jesus and the last supper and love. They are very community centered people that are always trying to help others although sometimes they can be a bit persistent about their beliefs. My paternal grandparents are devout catholics and very traditional filipino-chinese-possibly spanish (can’t tell if the surname means anything) people. My grandfather is a very successful businessman in the Philippines born to a family that founded a town in Quezon province. My grandmother is a very highly educated woman who left high school a year ahead to go study chemistry at university and is an amazing home maker. She was the daughter of the first plastic surgeon in the Philippines. I love all my family but I do feel closer to my dad’s side of the family as they were the dominating force of my upbringing.<br>
<br>
<b>My Thoughts:</b><br>While I already knew most of these things because my sister and I are relatively close, it was still a lot of fun interviewing her. While I was very different from my sister with the way she felt when it came to being religious since she found it to be something that was important in order to be a good filipino daughter, I still understand how she felt as I have seen the expectations first hand. However, the way I saw it was very different when I was younger as I was never the type to just follow the crowd when it came to religion. I can vouch for my sister when she says that she became like a third parent to my brother and I as I find that when I was younger and even today, I come to her a lot more with stuff you would traditionally go to a parent with. I always love having discussions like these with Sami and look forward to the next (hopefully soon) discussion.<br>
