<b>Where were you born?</b><br> I was born in Long Beach, California, USA, on December 29, 1951.<br>


<br>


<b>How did you come to NZ?</b><br> I came to New Zealand in 1972 because the Independent Missionary Organization I was working with was expanding from the US to Australia and New Zealand.<br>


<br>


<b>What was your house like as a child?</b><br>My household as a child often changed as my dad was a principal of a school and my mother was a teacher. They were asked to work at different schools so we moved a lot. I was an only child and remember being lonely at times and really enjoyed visiting my Aunts and Uncles and seeing all my cousins. We lived in California and they in Nevada so it wasn't too far for visits.<br>


<br>


<b>Do you practice a religion?</b><br>I don't belong to any religion now but just tell people that I am a Christian and I try to share my faith with others.<br>


<br>


<b>What impact has religion had on your life?</b><br>My parents were Catholics but we only went to church on Easter and Christmas. But I always remember believing in God and Jesus. My faith in Jesus has led me to become a Missionary and travel to many countries, ie, India, Bangladesh, The Philippines, China, and Kenya in Africa. It is through being a Missionary I met my wife, your Nana and we had 4 beautiful children who have given us 8 beautiful and handsome grandchildren!<br>


<br>


<b>What were your hobbies?</b><br>As a young teenager I built many models of cars and ships and planes. Then I became interested in Tropical Fish Aquariums. And now I'd say it's Gardening.<br>

<b>How did you hear about world news?</b><br>By TV and Radio.<br>


<br>


<b>What could you tell me that I would be surprised to learn about you?</b><br>I've been thinking about this one and the thing that came to me was about how I saved a girl's life once. I was camping out with my parents and friends in Yosemite National Park in Northern California when I was about 9 years old. I was a pretty good swimmer even then. I was swimming in the river  and my friend Marcy was too and she got into trouble and started to drown. So I got ahold of her and pulled her to the shore to safety. So that's something even Nana didn't know until I told it here.<br>


<br>


<b>What is the earliest memory that you have?</b><br>I'd say I was about 3 or 4 years old we lived in a white house and my Mother really loved animals so she allowed our pet rabbit into the house and I remember the rabbit leaving his little poops everywhere and he also chewed the curtains. Then we moved to another house that was yellow and I was about 5 then and there was a sliding glass door that my dad had left open to move stuff through as we moved in. My Mother saw the door open so she closed it. However my Dad did not see that it was closed and crashed into it and got some pretty bad cuts. So, because there was no glass there anymore they put up a blanket to keep the cold air out. A few days later the glass got replaced but I didn't know that. So in my little brain I thought, ok it you ever break glass put a blanket over it and in a few days you'll get new glass to fill in the frame! Ha!<br>


<br>


<b>What do you remember about your parents or grandparents?</b><br>First My Dad. He really liked to take me out to fancy restrurants. Then we were settled in our place and the waiter would come for our order, he'd have me talk to the waiter and order our meal. One time howeverr when I ordered chicken and then went to the toilet, my Dad changed the order from chicken to "Frogs Legs". When our meal arrived I started to eat what I thought to be chicken and it was very stringy and had black vaines in it. I said what is this? My Dad said It's Frogs Legs, I wanted you to learn to eat new and different foods---Ha--Yuck! Now my Mother, who in America we call Mom. She really liked her TV shows, but would insist we sat at the dining room table to eat dinner. So, we sat at the dinner table and looked out the big picture window the whole time watching the reflection of the TV show in the window. The neighbours must of thought we were crazy because as we ate we were always looking out at them!--Ha! My Grandparents who born in Ireland, now lived in the Bronx, New York  We lived in California about 3,000 km away. We visited them about once every 3 or 4 years. I heard a story about my Grandfather that at the age of 80 he was teaching young people how to dance irish dancing! Just for intrest sake--My Grandfather's name was Michael my Dad's name was Dennis and My name is Michael Dennis Murphy!<br>


<br>


<b>My Thoughts:</b><br>His upbringing seems very different to the other as the rest of us grew up in quite big families. I do miss talking to my grandparents as they live quite far away and I do believe I should talk to them more. His religious views are quite different compared to the rest of them and his hobbies are very different. It seems that things were very different then and I am excited to talk  to them more. <br>
