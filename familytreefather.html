<b>Where were you born?</b><br> I was born in Makati City in Manila.<br>


<br>


<b>How did you come to NZ?</b><br> I married a NZ citizen and she wanted to move to NZ so we did.<br>


<br>


<b>What was your house like as a child?</b><br>We were a relatively wealthy family. Growing up, we had maids to clean the house and each of my siblings had their own nanny. All of our nannies except for my sister's spoke English and so that's how I learned English.<br>


<br>


<b>Do you practice a religion?</b><br> No, I am an athiest.<br>


<br>


<b>What impact has religion had on your life?</b><br> There is no distinction between schools in the Philippines because they are all catholic. Even private schools are Catholic. Private schools may not explicitly say that they don’t have any religious orientation but in practice, they are catholic schools because all teachers effectively teach with Catholicism in mind because of their personal beliefs and the overall culture. Due to this, I grew up having great knowledge of Christianity, its history and its roots in the Jewish religion. Because of this, I also had an interest in history and how the western world and western way of thinking has very deep roots in Judeo Christian thought and philosophy. In the long run, the way that religion permeated all aspects of life influenced how I thought, my taste in music, decisions I made in life, effectively in a way that was contrary to the religion. My interest in matters of history and how it related to religion has made me conclude, due to the enforcement of the harsher aspects of the religion, that at worst, religion is a way for people to control others and make some money off of them. At its best, religion gives hope for people who can’t handle the fact that there may not be any deeper meaning to existence at all.<br>


<br>


<b>What were your hobbies?</b><br> Growing up, I liked martial arts, building models and music.<br>

<br>


<b>How did you hear about world news?</b><br> I heard about news through tv, newspaper and radio. <br>


<br>


<b>What could you tell me that I would be surprised to learn about you?</b><br> During my tweens, I was bullied.<br>


<br>


<b>What is the earliest memory that you have?</b><br>The earliest memory I have is looking up and seeing the mosquito screen of a window in the house that they lived in.<br>


<br>


<b>What do you remember about your parents or grandparents?</b><br>My maternal grandparents were quite a bit older. My mom was one of their younger children and the only memory I have of my maternal grandad is how we were all told that we had to behave when he was around. It was implied that we had to be scared of them and I remember being at their house with my cousins, having fun and being rowdy when I turned around and saw him. I thought “uh oh” but he wasn’t angry, he was half smiling actually. My maternal grandma was not really close to anyone because she had so many grandchildren. She was nice, we would stay at her house for a few days and have breakfast with her. We were always closer to the paternal side of the grandparents family. We stayed at my paternal grandparents house more. Mama Ying (grandmother) had a temper and I would get scolded a lot. One time, she got mad at someone in the neighbourhood because they had the party line on the phone. She wanted to make a phone call so she asked to make one and got mad. Papa Sito (grandfather) came home from work and saw Mama Ying taking a gun hidden in newspaper and going to that person’s house (you could either laugh it off or think it’s psychotic). Papa Sito was my favorite. He was always happy and positive. He was confident but not arrogant. He joked around a lot. He invented (for them) how to circumvent the Lenten restriction of not eating meat on Friday. So during lent, every time it was Friday, he would eat all of the nice seafood like shrimp, crab, squid, lobster etc. and so we would always try to sneak over to his house. He liked playing piano. While he was a very fun guy, he wasn’t irresponsible, he was reliable. He had 5 kids on his own and none of them were ever left hungry. He lived life well, he knew how to live, he knew what it was all about, he didn’t worry and didn’t sweat the small stuff.<br>

<b>My Thoughts:</b><br> With regards to my dad's views on religion, while I understand his opinions due to my knowledge of his upbringing, I believe that they are a little bit cynical and do not completely line up with my own. However, I will say that I do believe that there is a certain amount of truth to them. I find my father's upbringing quite interesting and the memories he has of his grandparents more so as they are quite different to what I experienced growing up and learning about my great grandparents was very... interesting. I found it quite surprising that my dad was bullied in school as the man I know does not seem to be easily pushed around. Overall, it was very entertaining speaking to my dad about the life he had before us and I may ask him more about what life was like back in the Philippines.<br>
